# Deploy MCP Server to Cloudflare Workers
#
# This workflow is manual-only (workflow_dispatch) to prevent accidental deploys.
# To enable auto-deploy, add: push: branches: [main]
# Configure the following secrets in your repository:
#   - CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN: API token with Workers and R2 permissions
#   - CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID: Your Cloudflare account ID
#
# Optional: Set up branch protection to require PR reviews before deploy.
